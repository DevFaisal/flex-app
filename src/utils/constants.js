    question: 'Why the name Flex?',
    answer: `
        Because credit should bend, not break you. Picture two wallets, facing each other. Or two
        coins, having a chat across the front desk. It's about give and take — a fair way to borrow,
        repay, and move on. Flex means freedom. Flex means choice. Flex means you're in control —
        and you only pay for what you owe. That's it. No tricks, no stress. Just credit that fits
        you.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What does Pay For What You Owe actually mean?',
    answer: `Most credit cards make you jump through hoops — you pay some off, but still get charged
        interest on the whole amount. Not with Flex. With Flex, you only pay interest on what's
        left. Let's say you've spent £1,000 and you repay £300. You'll only pay interest on the
        remaining £700. That's it. You also get to choose how much to repay — 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or
        even a custom amount — and we'll show you exactly how much interest you'll pay and how much
        you'll save with each option. You stay in control, every step of the way.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get Flex now?',
    answer: `Not just yet — but we're working on it! We're getting ready for Phase 1 of our launch, and
        we're doing things properly. That means going through the official FCA application process,
        so we can launch with the right protections in place. Wish us luck — and thanks for being
        part of the journey. If you join the waitlist now, you'll be one of the first to know when
        Flex goes live. No obligations, no pressure.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Will joining the waitlist affect my credit score?',
    answer: `Nope. Joining the waitlist is totally safe — there's no credit check and no impact on your
        credit score. We'll only run a check if (and when) you apply later — and even then, we'll
        make everything crystal clear before you go ahead.`,

  //     question: 'How is Flex different from other credit cards?',
  //     answer: (
  //       <div className="text-gray-700">
  //         We built Flex because we've made partial repayments, thought we were doing the right thing —
  //         only to be hit with interest we didn't expect.
  //         <p className="mt-2">
  //           So, we listened. We spoke to people like us, and built Flex for all of us — because real
  //           life isn't one-size-fits-all. And credit shouldn't be either.
  //         </p>
  //         <p>Let's break it down:</p>
  //         <p className="font-bold mt-2">With traditional credit cards:</p>
  //         <p>
  //           You spend £1,000 on 8 March. Your statement closes on 10 March. You repay £500 on 20
  //           March.
  //         </p>
  //         <p>Sounds fair enough, right?</p>
  //         <p>But here's the catch:</p>
  //         <p>
  //           You'll still be charged interest on the full £1,000 — not just the £500 you didn't repay.
  //         </p>
  //         <p>And not just from your statement date — but from the day you made the purchase.</p>
  //         <p>That interest keeps compounding daily until you clear the full balance.</p>
  //         <p>
  //           So even when you're trying to do the right thing, you can end up paying more than you
  //           expected.
  //         </p>
  //         <p className="font-bold mt-2">Flex works differently — because we think differently:</p>
  //         <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-1">
  //           <li>You choose how much to repay — 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or a custom amount</li>
  //           <li>We only charge interest on what's left, not your full statement</li>
  //           <li>
  //             You'll see exactly how much interest you're being charged — and how much you're saving —
  //             before you commit
  //           </li>
  //           <li>Late fees are capped at £5, not £12 or more</li>
  //           <li>And yes, we're app-only, built for your phone and your lifestyle</li>
  //         </ul>
  //         <p className="mt-2">
  //           We built Flex to make credit work for real people — not just the system.
  //         </p>
  //         <p>No tricks. No compounding traps. Just credit that makes sense.</p>
