    text: "Going back to university for an MBA meant no salary for a while. I knew I had to plan my finances carefully, but in our focus group, I realised just how unfair standard credit cards are. If FlexCard existed, I’d have had a way to make partial repayments without getting hit with interest on my full balance. It’s exactly what students and career changers need—I can’t wait for it to go live!",

    text: "Running a startup means cash flow can be unpredictable. Some months are great, others are tight. I never realised that most credit cards lock you into a rigid repayment system—making you pay interest on money you’ve already cleared. If FlexCard existed, it would be a game-changer for founders like me. Can’t wait to get my hands on it!",

    text: "I love shopping, and I return a lot of stuff. But I never thought twice about how refunds actually work—until our focus group. Turns out, if a refund happens after your statement cycle, it doesn't count as a payment—meaning you still get charged interest on something you don’t even own anymore! WTF?! If FlexCard existed, I wouldn’t have wasted so much money on interest for things I returned. Now I’m just waiting for it to launch!",

    text: "I love the flexibility of working for six months and then taking six months off, but managing cash flow can be tricky. In our focus group, I learned how traditional credit cards charge interest on the full balance—even when you’re making repayments. If FlexCard existed, it would be perfect for people like me who need financial flexibility without being punished with interest. I can’t wait for it to launch!",

    text: "I always buy a few sizes when I shop online—who doesn’t? But I never realised that if my refund doesn’t hit before the statement cycle closes, I still get charged interest on it. In our focus group, I found out that even though I returned the items, my credit card acted like I still owed the money. That’s insane! If FlexCard existed, it would finally fix this unfair system. Seriously, I need this card in my life!",

In our focus group, I realised how unfair it is that traditional credit cards charge interest on the full balance—even when you make repayments. If FlexCard existed, I would have had a fairer way to manage my payments. I can’t wait for it to launch!",

In our discussions, it became clear that if FlexCard was around, it would have been the perfect solution—allowing me to adjust my repayments without worrying about crazy interest charges. I love that it actually rewards responsible borrowers. I’ll be one of the first in line when it launches!",

Now I know that most of them are designed to trap you with unfair interest charges. If FlexCard existed when I got my first job, I would have had a much better way to manage my money.

In our focus group, I found out the shocking truth—most cards still charge you full interest even when you’re paying off a big chunk. If FlexCard existed, it would finally give people like me a fairer way to manage credit. It’s about time!",

In the focus group, I learned how traditional credit cards punish you with full interest, even if you pay off most of your balance. If FlexCard were available, it would have been a game-changer for me. I’m excited to be part of the early adopters!",
