        <p>
          We built Flex because we've made partial repayments, thought we were doing the right thing — only to be hit
          with interest we didn't expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, we listened. We spoke to people like us, and built Flex for all of us — because real life isn't
          one-size-fits-all. And credit shouldn't be either.
        </p>
        <p>Let's break it down:</p>
        <p className="font-bold mt-2">With traditional credit cards:</p>
        <p>You spend £1,000 on 8 March. Your statement closes on 10 March. You repay £500 on 20 March.</p>
        <p>Sounds fair enough, right?</p>
        <p>But here's the catch:</p>
        <p>You'll still be charged interest on the full £1,000 — not just the £500 you didn't repay.</p>
        <p>And not just from your statement date — but from the day you made the purchase.</p>
        <p>That interest keeps compounding daily until you clear the full balance.</p>
        <p>So even when you're trying to do the right thing, you can end up paying more than you expected.</p>
        <p className="font-bold mt-2">Flex works differently — because we think differently:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-1">
          <li>You choose how much to repay — 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or a custom amount</li>
          <li>We only charge interest on what's left, not your full statement</li>
          <li>
            You'll see exactly how much interest you're being charged — and how much you're saving — before you commit
          </li>
          <li>Late fees are capped at £5, not £12 or more</li>
          <li>And yes, we're app-only, built for your phone and your lifestyle</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">We built Flex to make credit work for real people — not just the system.</p>
